I2C to RJ45 Breakouts for Light Switch Controller
=================================================

Copyright 2019-2021 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd  www.superhouse.tv

These I2C to RJ45 breakouts are one component of the SuperHouse home
automation light switch controller project. They allow light switches
to be connected to a controller such as an Arduino, Raspberry Pi,
or ESP8266/ESP32 board.

The RJ45 sockets on the breakout are connected to I/O channels via
I2C addressable I/O buffers. Each RJ45 socket provides connections for
GND, 12V, and 4 signal lines.
